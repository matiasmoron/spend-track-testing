# Vercel Environment Fix

## 🐛 Problem

Vercel build was failing because:

```
apt-get: command not found
Failed to install browsers
Error: Installation process exited with code: 127
```

The `--with-deps` flag tries to install system dependencies using `apt-get`, but Vercel's build environment doesn't support this.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Created Vercel-Specific Build Command**

```json
{
  "build-reports:vercel": "playwright install chromium && playwright test --reporter=html --project=chromium"
}
```

### 2. **Updated Vercel Configuration**

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "yarn build-reports:vercel"
}
```

### 3. **Environment-Aware CI Script**

Updated `scripts/build-ci.sh` to detect Vercel environment:

```bash
if [ -n "$VERCEL" ]; then
    yarn playwright install chromium
else
    yarn playwright install --with-deps
fi
```

## 🎯 Key Changes

| Environment        | Command                     | Dependencies                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Local**          | `yarn build-reports`        | `--with-deps` (full system deps) |
| **GitHub Actions** | `yarn build-reports:ci`     | Standard install                 |
| **Vercel**         | `yarn build-reports:vercel` | Chromium only (no system deps)   |

## 🚀 Why This Works

✅ **No System Dependencies**: Vercel doesn't need `apt-get` packages  
✅ **Chromium Only**: Faster installation and sufficient for CI  
✅ **Environment Detection**: Different strategies for different platforms  
✅ **Fallback Safe**: Still works if environment detection fails

## 📊 Expected Results

1. **Faster Build**: Only installs Chromium browser
2. **No Dependency Errors**: Avoids system package installation
3. **Successful Deployment**: Reports should generate and deploy
4. **Consistent Results**: Same test coverage, just one browser

## 🔍 Next Steps

Try deploying again! The build should now:

1. ✅ Install only Chromium browser (no system deps)
2. ✅ Run tests successfully
3. ✅ Generate HTML reports
4. ✅ Deploy to Vercel successfully

**The key insight**: Vercel's serverless environment doesn't need system dependencies - just the browser binaries! 🎉
