# Deployment Fix for Playwright Browser Installation

## 🐛 Problem

Vercel deployment was failing with the error:

```
Looks like Playwright Test or Playwright was just installed or updated.
Please run the following command to download new browsers:
    yarn playwright install
```

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Updated Package.json Scripts**

```json
{
  "build-reports": "playwright install --with-deps && playwright test --reporter=html",
  "build-reports:ci": "playwright install --with-deps && playwright test --reporter=html --project=chromium",
  "build-reports:script": "./scripts/build-ci.sh"
}
```

### 2. **Updated Vercel Configuration**

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "yarn build-reports:script"
}
```

### 3. **Enhanced GitHub Actions**

Added explicit browser installation step:

```yaml
- name: Install Playwright browsers
  run: yarn playwright install --with-deps
```

### 4. **Created Robust CI Script**

`scripts/build-ci.sh` handles:

- Browser installation with system dependencies
- Test execution with error handling
- Fallback HTML generation if tests fail
- Proper exit codes for CI/CD

## 🎯 Key Changes

| Component          | Before                            | After                                                               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Build Command**  | `playwright test --reporter=html` | `playwright install --with-deps && playwright test --reporter=html` |
| **CI Strategy**    | Run all browsers                  | Run Chromium only (faster CI)                                       |
| **Error Handling** | Fail completely                   | Generate report even on test failures                               |
| **Dependencies**   | Browsers only                     | Browsers + system dependencies                                      |

## 🚀 Benefits

✅ **Faster Deployments** - Only runs Chromium in CI  
✅ **Reliable Builds** - Always installs fresh browsers  
✅ **Better Error Reporting** - Shows what failed instead of build errors  
✅ **System Dependencies** - Includes all required libraries

## 🔧 Local Testing

```bash
# Test the CI build locally
yarn build-reports:ci

# Test the full build (all browsers)
yarn build-reports

# Test the deployment script
./scripts/build-ci.sh
```

## 📊 What to Expect

1. **Deployment Time**: Slightly longer (installs browsers first)
2. **Success Rate**: Much higher (handles browser installation)
3. **Error Visibility**: Clear reports even when tests fail
4. **Resource Usage**: Optimized for CI (Chromium only)

## 🔍 Monitoring

- **Vercel Dashboard**: Check build logs for browser installation
- **GitHub Actions**: Verify browser installation step passes
- **Test Reports**: Should now deploy successfully even with test failures

---

**Next Deployment**: Try deploying again - it should now install browsers properly and succeed! 🎉
